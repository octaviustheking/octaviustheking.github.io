            <p>I did like one commit yesterday because I was busy playing Overwatch... I think I have an obsession. It's a hero shooter and in first person, but it's not really an fps. All the heroes have different abilities, weapons, etc. What makes it really fun are the 3 different roles (tank, damage, and support), and it requires like a lot of game sense. </p>
            <p>I downloaded CS2, and I'm too scared to play a real match T-T. It feels really weird, cuz shift is walk, you have to stand still to shoot a rifle accurately, etc. The movement feels really slow ARGH. I just want to play something like Phantom Forces on Steam please someone make something like it. </p>
            <p>I'm so LAZY, how do I do the projects page???? Also, I need to find a way to share a terminal Java game for Hack Club.... lkadsjfl;adsk;fla</p>

            <h3>12/5/25</h3>
            <p>I'm so freaking tired... I had to wake up at 6:40 T-T...</p>
            <p>Anyway, I went on Github during my AP Human class, and I found an issue that my friend put on Blackhack. Mind you, I still haven't fixed the counter issue, but that's another thing. Anyway, I was made aware that I did not reset the card list every single game. Rather, I just added an entire new deck to the card list every game. I'm so stupid ARGH</p>
            <p>I also found some other issues, like the console printing "a ace" instead of "an ace". I plan to add some new items. One thing I want to add is a double-up card, which doubles your bet. Another thing I want to add is the concept of "negative cards", which basically reduce your value.</p>
            <p>In the Studio BDT Github, I created a repository called "blackjacks", and it's basically a compilation of all of Studio BDT's blackjacks. We have NeoRazer's Black-Jack, my blackhack, and SamZua's hackjack (soon to come). We're thinking of making the ultimate blackjack terminal game together. The logical name for it would be hackhack (lol). </p>

            <h2 id="6">blackhack and manga</h2>
            <h3>12/4/25</h3>
            <p>So I found this new manga called Koi to Yobu ni wa Sasayaka desuga, or It's Not Quite Love Yet, but..., and it's by the artist of Horimiya (so I already knew the art was going to be PEAK). Unfortunately, one chapter releases EVERY MONTH. THERE ARE ONLY TWO CHAPTERS. PLEASE I NEED MORE!!</p>
            <p>About Blackhack, I was playing it with my friend in my software class because I was really bored after finishing all my work. I played for like 30 minutes, so I discovered this bug. I thought my card counting algorithm worked fine, but apparantly it doesn't work in the one case of one ten and one ace. This would be 21, but my algorithm counted it as 11. Basically, this happens because I add one for every ace there is, and if the amount is less than 11, I add 10 (the rest of the value of the ace). Unfortunately, 10 + 1 = 11, which is less than 11. This leads to the 10 not being added even though it can. </p>
            <p>I have two ways that I want to go about fixing this. The first way is add 11 for every ace, and if the value is above 21, subtract 10 for every ace there is until it is below 21. However, I don't really like this solution. The other way is to check with an if loop if adding 10 would cause the player to bust, instead of checking if its below 11. I like this one better, but I'll do some testing to see which one is better. </p>
